With this simple code you will be abble to implement an [AppScript](https://developers.google.com/apps-script?hl=es-419) in your forms to send every response to a discord channel using integrations.

## Installation

### 1. Workspace and code
In your forms options go to AppScript and a new tab should show the Google Script IDE. Then, just paste the code and modify the weebhook const with your own.

Make sure you select the very last Type of event, which will run the script every time a form is sent.
